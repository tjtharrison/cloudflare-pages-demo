Demo repository for hosting a Cloudflare pages site

This repository will be used to host a Cloudflare pages site. The site will be a simple static site with a few pages for demonstration of an article on my [medium.com](https://tjtharrison.medium.com/).

## Repo contents:

- `pages/` - This directory contains the pages that will be uploaded to Cloudflare pages. The script will upload all files in this directory to the root of the site.
- `scripts/` - This directory contains the script that will be used to upload the pages to Cloudflare pages. The script is written in Python and uses the Cloudflare API to upload the pages.
- `README.md` - This file is the README for the repository. It will be uploaded to the root of the site as the body for the index page.
- `template.html` - This file is a template for the pages that will be uploaded to Cloudflare pages. The script will use this template to create the pages that will be uploaded to Cloudflare pages.
- `example_page.md` - This file is an example page that will be picked up by the script and uploaded to Cloudflare pages
